# Variational-Autoencoder
The code implements a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) using PyTorch, a popular deep learning framework known for its flexibility and efficiency in neural network implementations. The VAE is a generative model capable of learning a low-dimensional representation of complex data distributions, enabling it to generate new samples that resemble the original data. The code follows a structured approach, with distinct steps for dataset preparation, model architecture definition, training setup, sample generation, and optional model evaluation and saving.
In the dataset preparation phase, the code loads the dataset from a CSV file using NumPy's loadtxt function, assuming a comma-separated format and skipping the first row, which typically contains headers.
Moving to model architecture definition, the VAE architecture is implemented within the innit class. The encoder consists of several fully connected layers followed by ReLU activation functions, progressively reducing the input dimensionality until reaching the desired latent space dimension multiplied by 2, as required for the mean and variance parameters of the latent distribution. The decoder mirrors this structure, mapping the latent space representation back to the original input dimensionality. This symmetrical architecture enables the VAE to learn an efficient encoding and decoding scheme for the given dataset.
The loss function of the VAE combines two key components: reconstruction loss and KL divergence regularization. The reconstruction loss measures the dissimilarity between the input data and the reconstructed output from the decoder, ensuring that the VAE learns to faithfully reproduce the original samples. Meanwhile, the KL divergence term encourages the latent space to conform to a chosen prior distribution, typically a multivariate Gaussian distribution. This regularization term helps prevent overfitting and ensures that the learned latent representations are meaningful.
Moving forward to the training setup, essential hyperparameters such as learning rate, number of epochs, batch size, and log interval are defined. The code dynamically checks for the availability of GPU acceleration and moves the VAE model to the appropriate device (GPU T4 through colab). The training data is converted into PyTorch's TensorDataset format and wrapped in a DataLoader for efficient batch processing during training.
During the training loop, the VAE is trained using stochastic gradient descent with the Adam optimizer, a popular choice for training neural networks due to its adaptive learning rate properties. The loss function is computed for each batch, and gradients are backpropagated through the network to update the model parameters. The training loss is monitored and printed at regular intervals to track the model's convergence and performance over epochs.
After training, the VAE is capable of generating new samples by sampling from the learned latent space and decoding these samples using the decoder. The generated samples are then saved to a CSV file, allowing users to inspect and analyze the synthetic data. Additionally, the code optionally provides functionality for evaluating the trained VAE, such as computing reconstruction loss and other relevant metrics to assess model performance. Furthermore, the trained VAE model's parameters can be saved to a file for future use or deployment in other applications.
In summary, the provided code offers a comprehensive implementation of a Variational Autoencoder using PyTorch, encompassing data preprocessing, model construction, training, sample generation, and optional evaluation and saving functionalities. While the code exhibits a well-structured workflow and leverages powerful deep learning libraries effectively.
